Implementations of Elementary Data Structures in Python

The best way to understand data structures and algorithms is a two-pronged approach. You can, first of all, study them as purely abstract 'mathematical objects'. On the one hand, 
this builds a decent foundation for a *sort* of conceptual mastery. But on the other hand, 'pencil-on-paper' thinking is often suprisingly far away from the *design thinking* which alone allows one 
to come up with a working, concrete implementation of a particular data structure or algorithm in a particular language. Indeed, one often only realizes just how many details are elided 
(intentionally!) when studying a data structure or algorithm in the abstract when one goes to implement that structure in her preferred language. 

The reason is that there are many minute differences between programming langauges which - if focused on - would only distract from the goal of building up a robust conceptual understanding in 
the abstract context. Similarly, there are features which are common to nearly all languages which are suppressed or ignored in abstract presentations in order to achieve a cleaner presentation 
of the centrally important 'theoretical' elements. 

This repository will (eventually) contain implementations of rudimentary data structures in Python. The hope is that it may prove helpful to those trying to learn these topics for the first time,
and for whom looking at and studying *actual implementations* may prove beneficial. Python is a good choice here since, as has often been noted, it has a simple and readable syntax which often 
pretty closely approaches that of common flavors of pseudocode. That means that the algorithms and data structures one sees on the page are often still clearly recognizable when rendered in 
Python. 

One thing that will not be found here (ever) is any effort to write the most elegent and efficient implementations of any of the basic algorithms and data strucutres covered. The quest for 
greater computational efficiency is never ending, and is the real work for all of us who make any part of our living trying to use such tools to solve problems (whether 'real world' or 'academic' 
in nature).

The goal of this repository is, in other words, mainly pedagogical. If you think there's a better way to implement something contained herein, you are almost certainly correct. So go ahead and
*do it*, and feel free to share what you've found freely with others. We'll all learn better that way.
